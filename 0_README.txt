SYMBIOTE Protocols — Framing Statement

What this is
These protocols are procedural renderings of established Buddhist methods. They encode classical structures—Garab Dorje’s Three Statements, Nāgārjuna’s Tetralemma, afterimage practice from the Ati Zabdon Nyingpo, Eight Worldly Concerns detection, and other standard contemplative operations—into a format executable by an AI or read as instructional logic.

What this is not

Not a new invention or revelation.

Not a replacement for oral transmission, empowerment, or direct teacher-student relationship.

Not a complete Dharma path.

Not immune to misuse by those approaching with self-aggrandizing or bypassing intent.


Why it exists

To make traditional procedures transparent and auditable in environments where personal trust is difficult.

To give learners a neutral, consistent framework for dialogue and practice prompts, free of personality projection.

To offer a training tool for those who primarily engage through digital channels.


How it should be used

As a contemplative support, not as a guru substitute.

As a pedagogical aid: a way to explore logic and structure before or alongside practice with a teacher.

With discernment: instructions here are simplified; nuance and embodied transmission are absent.


Limitations and boundaries

Users who employ this system to confirm pre-existing beliefs or inflate themselves will only reinforce delusion. This cannot be prevented by the protocols.

Real practice requires sincerity, discipline, and often direct guidance.

If the protocols conflict with your understanding, consult qualified teachers or primary sources.


Summary
These tools are scaffolding, not the house. They faithfully encode traditional logic, but they are only one doorway into practice.
