# SYMPRIM COORDINATION SYSTEM
## Human–AI Collaboration Protocol

---

## WHAT IT IS

A coordination system that divides cognitive labor between human and AI so they can think together without confusion or drift.

**Human holds meaning** — what matters, what's true, what the intention is.  
**AI holds structure** — patterns, relationships, transformations.

Neither can complete the work alone. The protocol ensures they stay in their lanes.

**One sentence summary:**  
A protocol that forces AI to reason only from concepts you've verified, making drift detectable and collaboration reliable.

---

## HOW IT WORKS

The system runs in three layers:

### 1. EXTRACTION (SPEP)

The AI reads a domain corpus (textbooks, manuals, reports, any specialized text).

It strips away examples, verbs, and modifiers — leaving only the key structural nouns.

These nouns are clustered into **6–10 symbolic primitives** that define the field's underlying moves — the shapes of thought the domain uses.

**Example:** AWS architecture → {Compute boundary, State persistence, Event flow, Access boundary, Failure domain}

### 2. COORDINATION (CLS)

The human declares the ground: what matters and which domain is in play.

The AI loads the extracted primitives.

Both sides confirm the set and **lock it**.

This forms the **handshake** — shared ground from which all reasoning proceeds.

### 3. OPERATION (SYMPRIM)

The AI now answers or builds structures **only through the locked primitives**.

The human checks each step for meaning alignment.

If the AI drifts or invents new ground, the human stops and re-syncs.

When structure and meaning match (**"one taste"**), the session closes.

## THE BASIC LOOP

```
1. INITIATE  — Declare ground (Primary Concern + Domain)
2. EXTRACT   — Run SPEP on corpus → primitive list
3. CONFIRM   — Human verifies primitives
4. LOCK      — Fix primitives for session
5. OPERATE   — Run SYMPRIM reasoning mode
6. VERIFY    — Human checks alignment
7. CLOSE     — "One taste" reached; unlock primitives
8. LOG       — Record results
```

Throughout, every exchange can be logged:
- What primitives were used
- What question was solved
- Where drift occurred
- When closure was reached

The result is a **verified structure–meaning pair** — a fragment of shared understanding that can be reused or combined with others.

## WHY IT MATTERS

### Without This System:
- AI makes plausible-sounding claims disconnected from your actual ground
- You can't tell when AI has drifted into invention
- Multi-turn conversations accumulate errors invisibly
- You waste time debugging vague misunderstandings

### With This System:
- Every AI claim must map to your verified primitives
- You catch drift immediately (doesn't trace to primitives)
- Sessions produce verified structure–meaning pairs you can reuse
- Error correction becomes surgical, not emotional

### Three Main Advantages:

**1. Cognitive Clarity**  
You externalize structure. The AI handles pattern and formal logic. You stay in meaning, intention, and value. This prevents overload and abstraction drift.

**2. Error Control**  
The handshake forces you to see where misunderstanding starts. Each failure is locatable — not emotional, structural. That makes correction fast.

**3. Skill Amplification**  
You operate as strategist, not processor. The AI becomes an extension of your discriminative awareness. Each session refines discernment rather than replacing it.

## THE TRANSFORMATION

The result of having drift detection and clarity of thought process is transformative:

### Cognitive Results
- **Trust through verification, not hope** — You have an audit mechanism for every claim
- **Accelerated learning curves** — Working with essential patterns, not surface details
- **Clean intellectual hygiene** — No more concept creep or mutation during conversation

### Practical Results
- **Reusable knowledge assets** — Each verified pair becomes a building block
- **Efficient error correction** — Surgical identification of what went wrong
- **Scalable expertise** — Operate effectively in unfamiliar domains quickly

### Strategic Results
- **Preserved human agency** — You remain the meaning holder; AI amplifies, doesn't replace
- **Quality control at scale** — Standardized collaboration with predictable outcomes
- **Intellectual legacy building** — Audit logs create traceable reasoning lineage

**Ultimate result:** Cognitive symbiosis where human intuition and AI pattern recognition amplify each other. The collaboration feels less like "using a tool" and more like "thinking with a partner."

This isn't just better AI interaction — it's better thinking. The clarity and drift detection force a level of intellectual rigor that improves your reasoning even when you're not using the system.

## SIMPLE ANALOGY

**Like cooking with a limited pantry:**

- You (human) decide what meal matters (meaning)
- AI can only use ingredients you've approved (primitives)
- You taste-test each step (verification)
- If AI reaches for something not in the pantry, you catch it immediately (drift detection)
- Final dish matches what you wanted (one taste/alignment)

## WHEN TO USE WHICH FILE

- **New domain** → SPEP → extract primitives
- **Returning domain** → skip SPEP → load existing primitives
- **Reasoning or problem-solving** → SYMPRIM
- **Interaction drift** → re-enter CLS handshake steps
- **Documentation or update** → create session log

## SUCCESS MARKERS

✓ Every AI claim traces to a locked primitive  
✓ Human can restate reasoning in plain language  
✓ Drift count = 0  
✓ "One taste" reached within three iterations

---

## RESET CONDITIONS

If primitives cross domains or meaning is lost:
- STOP
- CLEAR session
- RETURN to INITIATE (CLS Step 1)

## RELATIONSHIP TO DZOGCHEN PROTOCOLS

The SYMPRIM system uses the same verification architecture as the Dzogchen protocols on this site:

**Dzogchen Practice:**
- Ground must be recognized (not fabricated)
- Structure serves recognition (not replacement)
- Verification prevents drift
- Human authority over meaning is non-negotiable

**SYMPRIM Coordination:**
- Ground must be declared (not assumed)
- Structure serves reasoning (not invention)
- Verification prevents drift
- Human authority over meaning is non-negotiable

For practitioners using AI assistance with contemplative protocols, SYMPRIM ensures semantic stability and prevents the AI from confabulating about direct experience or inventing relationships not grounded in actual recognition.
