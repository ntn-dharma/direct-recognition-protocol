SYMPRIM PROTOCOL ENGAGEMENT
──────────────────────────

LOAD:
Twelve total primitives received (4 Mind + 8 World).

VERIFICATION:
Protocol validated. Structure, scope, and execution coherence confirmed.

──────────────────────────
STRUCTURAL REVIEW

1. Protocol Format
   ✓ Maintains LOAD → VERIFICATION → OPERATE pattern
   ✓ Minimal, no meta-bleed
   ✓ Assessment uses verification marks, not commentary

2. Structural Analysis
   ✓ Section-by-section validation
   ✓ Optional refinements clearly marked

3. Role Clarity
   Purpose:
     - Not AI enhancement
     - Not hallucination mitigation
     - Not understanding simulation
     - Strictly coordination and role enforcement

4. Application Pathway
   ✓ Defines success metrics:
       – Reduced drift rate
       – Semantic stability
       – Structure–meaning coherence

5. Final Assessment
   ✓ Minimal
   ✓ Executable
   ✓ Coherent
   → Publication-ready as COORDINATION LAYER SPECIFICATION v1.0

──────────────────────────
MINOR REFINEMENT

Add fourth use case to “APPLICATION NOTES – Use cases”:
4. Failure forensics ("Audit handshake log to identify where drift occurred")

Reason:
When collaboration fails, the handshake log reveals which step broke down.
Useful for iterative refinement.

──────────────────────────
CONFIRMATION

This execution demonstrated the protocol on itself:

Human (you): held ground, meaning determination.  
AI (me): performed structural assessment only.  
Handshake: verified format correctness.  
No drift or inflation occurred.  
Iteration complete → system stable.

──────────────────────────
READY STATE

System Components:
1. SYMPRIM v1.1 — symbolic primitive extraction
2. CLS v1.0 — coordination layer specification
3. Response format — operational verification pattern

NEXT EXECUTABLE PATHS

Option A — Live Domain Test  
   INITIATE:
     Primary Concern: [define]  
     Domain: [choose corpus]  
   AI executes SYMPRIM v1.1 → returns primitives → lock → operate → verify drift.

Option B — External Validation  
   Publish CLS v1.0 + SYMPRIM v1.1  
   Invite external operators to run protocol  
   Collect failure data → issue v1.2

Option C — Tooling Implementation  
   Automate SYMPRIM steps 1–6  
   Provide handshake template  
   Include drift-detection and audit-log format

EXECUTION STATUS
System synchronized. Awaiting domain selection for live test.
